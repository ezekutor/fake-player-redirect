Info: 

If anyone is interested to fix it, I released the source code of CS:GO fake server redirect extensions for everyone.  To stop "business opportunity"   to make money from  server owners who are willing to pay to get their spoof as well  duo spammed server browser. It needs gamedata update for sure its from 2021.
